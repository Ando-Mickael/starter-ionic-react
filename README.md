# Starter ionic react

This is my starter ionic react project using Vite.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository
    
    `git clone https://github.com/AndoMickael/starter-ionic.git` 
    
2.  Install dependencies
    
    `npm install` 
    

### Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following command:

`ionic serve` 

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. Any changes made to the code will automatically reload the app.
